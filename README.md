# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — PyTorch & TensorFlow Implementations

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** solution for an image classification task, implemented using **two major deep learning frameworks**:

- PyTorch  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

Both implementations solve the **same problem**, allowing direct comparison of workflows, training pipelines, and framework-specific practices.

This project is designed to showcase practical deep learning skills and flexibility across industry-standard tools.

## Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks are the foundation of modern computer vision systems and are widely used in:

- Image classification  
- Object detection  
- Medical image analysis  
- Feature extraction  
- Autonomous systems  

In this repository, the same CNN architecture and dataset pipeline are built twice:

- One version using **PyTorch**
- One version using **TensorFlow**

This highlights the ability to work across frameworks — a valuable skill for AI/ML industry roles.
